Architectural documentation for a fake system Make Cats Free (MCF)
## initial documentation
- [Initial requirements](https://github.com/mariakrol/mcf-documentation/blob/main/0-initial/initial-requirements.md)
- [Stakeholder's concerns](https://github.com/mariakrol/mcf-documentation/blob/main/0-initial/concerns.md)
## Steps of Work
1. Process Requirements

   - [x] Identify and prioritize stakeholders 
     - [Description of stakeholders](https://github.com/mariakrol/mcf-documentation/blob/main/1-process-reqirements/stakeholders.md)
     - [The Power-Interest matrix](https://www.figma.com/file/FAMXnWQgp8fuTqcJcSFDrd/MCF-Stakeholders?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=b1Nwv43zo5G7Xw2b-1)

   - [ ] Process requirements and search for constraints
   - [ ] Search for system characteristics

2. Analysis

   -[ ] Event Storming
   -[ ] Data Model
   -[ ] Analyzing Models with Strategic DDD
   -[ ] Identification of Characteristics for Elements
   -[ ] Calculation of Instability

3. Architectural Decisions

   -[ ] Select the architectural style of the system
   -[ ] Identifying service boundaries
   -[ ] Choice of the database type (types)
   -[ ] Selection of fitness functions
   -[ ] Documentation of the entire context of decisions
