- **Top Management**

  The stakeholder group is key. The influence is highest because it is the main source of demands and payments.
  The interest of the group is also high because the business area is innovative, but highly demanded and promising 
  of a new stand-alone product (scoring system).

- **HR Managers**

  HR managers are the main source of information about the recruitment process of employees, so they are key players in 
  the context of the scoring of potential employers who could be converted to a separately sold product. The influence 
  and interest of this group are quite high.

- **Quality Managers**

  The source of information about negative user experiences and failed tasks. One of the closest points of contact with 
  end users. The influence and interest of the group is quite high.

- **Service Managers**

  The group of managers is responsible for updating and supporting the available services. The influence and interest 
  are lower than the medium.

- **Account Managers (Finance Department)**

  The main source of legal financial information. Influence is higher than average, interest is lower than average.

- **Data Scientists**

  The area of business is innovative and the main way to increase the quality of hiring is to increase the number of 
  hypotheses and improve the quality of checks. So this group is one of the most important influencers. The influence
  and interest are high.

- **Developers**

  The point of concern is to be able to release the product quickly and be able to modify the product easily and 
  quickly. The group can be a source of information regarding development fixes and delivery.

- **Qa / Testers**

  The point of concern is to be able to release the product quickly and be able to modify the product easily and quickly.
  The group may be a source of information regarding development repair and delivery.

- **Betting System Developers**

  Since the betting system is hidden from most of the company, a developer working on it is the only source of 
  information about the technical state of the context. Since the area of responsibility is quite narrow, interest and 
  influence is low.

- **System Administrators**

  The system parts will have different release cycles, also it will be integrated with external systems (source of users,
  payment systems, cookie providers, etc.). So the deployment will be complex. One of the main points of concern is fast
  deployment and repairability. The group can provide valuable information about the processes.

- **Workers**

  Workers of the system are the key point of success of the whole business. The quality and speed of service delivery of 
  the worker will create a user experience of the whole system. So, their feedback will be important, and they are 
  extremely in the success since all payments will be made by satisfied end users.

- **Call Center / Support**

  Additional contact point for end users. Activated in case of problems or misunderstandings. In tandem with Quality 
  Managers, they handle all streams of negative UX and can create a set of common problems for improvement of the system.

- **Lawyers**

  As a financial department, lawyers are not interested in the development process, but all they comment on legal points
  are valuable and can make massive damage in case of ignoring.

- **Warehouse staff**

  The warehouse is an important part of the system. Quality and speed of equipment pickup are half of the success for the
  whole order, so feedback is important.

- **End users**

  Since the system is created for the market, not according to the order and the auditorium is huge, so impossible to 
  implement the requests and concerns of each individual user. All issues from end users are treated by quality managers 
  and support, and they are responsible for reporting common concerns and issues.
